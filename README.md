# To Do List

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The purpose of this app is to add, delete, and filter lists. The technologies I have used were **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript***. Challenges I have face while working on this project were, how to start it?, what would I need to know in order to achieve this?, how much hair will I pull out from working on this?. Bunch of research came into play about learning what methods are, transition effects, hover effects, what is a local storage and how to implement that? It was a benefical learning experience overall. Some future features I would implement is not making a todo list for a day but choosing a month and day from a calendar.</p>
